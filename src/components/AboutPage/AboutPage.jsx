        Hi, I’m Gabe. I graduated from San Diego State University where I have a
        bachelor’s degree in Kinesiology along with a minor in Psychology. I am
        currently a Certified Personal Trainer and Stretching and Flexibility
        Coach. I hope to become a strength and conditioning coach that assists
        athletes to better themselves physically and mentally. I am here because
        I have found that many do not appreciate or utilize stretching as a tool
        to improve our quality of life. I have been doing sports all my life and
        have grown to understand the needs and benefits of stretching in order
        to improve the mobility and recovery of the body. I enjoy helping others
        and I’m looking forward to working with all of you!
